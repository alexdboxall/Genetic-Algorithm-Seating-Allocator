# Seating Allocator using a Genetic Algorithm

A program to allocate people to tables based on their preferences on who they want to sit with. It uses a genetic algorithm to optimise the arrangement of the tables. It also presents a GUI to display the progress of the algorithm over time (the optimal arrangement is printed to the terminal).
